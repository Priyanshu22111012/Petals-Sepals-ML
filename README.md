# Petals-Sepals-ML
Iris flower Classification using ML

Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
This project aims to implement a machine learning model for classifying the species of the Iris flower based on the measurements of its sepals and petals. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the famous Iris dataset, which includes measurements of the sepals and petals of three different species of Iris flowers.

Goals
Build and train a machine learning model to accurately classify the species of Iris flower.
Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics and visualization techniques.
Provide a user-friendly interface for users to input new measurements and obtain predictions.
Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb to explore the code and experiment with the model.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.
